# The Monorepo

A monorepo created to be a single source of truth for code snippets, best practices, algorithms, data-structures, interesting solutions, and generally reused lines of code. A good amount of the code here will be over annotated or have extraneous lines of code or markup as a way to over comment and over document what the code is doing.
